            The lovely elements and professionally selected surfaces inside evoke a French coastal experience and create a world of soft colors and exquisite craftsmanship that invite you to love being at home. An intimate, gated courtyard leads to a simple, refined, iron and glass front door that opens to the elegance of a burnished cathedral-vault entry. 
            
            Soft ivory walls throughout the home are presented in a venetian plaster finish accented by brick walls washed in perfectly coordinated muted tones that create a luxurious but organic feel. Travertine floors flow throughout the downstairs and wood floors above. Beamed ceilings, understated antique French chandeliers, and a wood burning fireplace crafts serene environs for life on the Lake. 
            
            Designed for quiet repose away from the world, this home is also a hub for entertaining and embraces friends and family to share the surroundings. Living and dining areas open through two sets of recently installed huge glass doors onto the large and private patio covered in herringbone antique brick and enveloped in thick, artful landscaping. 
            
            The kitchen lacks nothing and seems to have been plucked from a French design magazine. Light, glazed perimeter custom cabinetry with a contrasting island that houses a large, undermount porcelain sink. Designed to maximize storage and with details important to the serious (or just adventurous) cook, there are spice racks, lined knife drawers, trash pullouts, refrigerator drawers, in addition to the paneled refrigerator, wall oven, microwave and a Thermador induction 5-burner cooktop.
            
            Off the kitchen is the laundry room with storage, built in ironing board and a utility sink. Plenty of recently installed storage cabinets line the garage and the floor has been freshly coated with epoxy. 
            
            Up the wood stairway flanked by a scrolled iron handrail, the three bedrooms have their own views and individual style and were crafted with the same soft colors and high quality finishes as the main living areas. Barrel vaults in one, cross-member beams in another and the tray ceiling master make each a special retreat. The master bath is graced by double burnished cathedral ceilings, each adorned with a beautiful crystal chandelier. The result is a captivating escape for a sumptuous soak in the jetted tub or a long luxurious shower under beautiful tiles behind the glass door.

905,austin,"Walking through the gated courtyard, a sense of sigh-inducing calm begins with a covered, private outdoor living area on one side and a bubbling fountain on the other. This peaceful welcome is enriched by an outdoor fireplace flanked by hanging chairs with thick cushions ready to serve as a respite from the world at the end of the day....or a great place for morning coffee before taking that day on.
            This elegant example of contemporary perfection starts hitting all the right notes from the warm embrace at the entry through the commercial glass pivoting front door to the picturesque privacy of the pool and grounds bordering a verdant greenspace beyond. The current owner, working with a professional designer, took what was already an incredible custom home and added subtle tones and touches to give each room an artful touch of glamor. Wide plank wood floors give way to tall, cut stone walls and add strong, earthy elements to the clean lines of the home's graceful, modern architecture.
            There is nothing left to wish for in a kitchen that is a chef's Disneyland. A workhorse space that resembles a page torn from Architectural Digest is anchored with a 6-1/2 by 9-1/2 foot island, a marble-clad piece of art that beckons to be used as serious prep space for a feast or a great place to gather for take-out. Large windows above the sink look out over treetops and into the hill country landscape. Sculpted white backsplash tiles surround a Wolf 6- burner cooktop with built-in grill and a massive stainless hood. A Sub Zero refrigerator paneled to hide within the line of sleek cabinetry, double wine refrigerators, a prep sink in the island and every bell and whistle needed to inspire professional chefs or family cooks exist in a space so beautiful it belies the utility of it. A giant pantry provides space for any attendant need for storage.
            The dining room, with walls of rich, silvery taupe, is surrounded with windows and opens to the front courtyard. Here, as in other rooms, the owner added a gorgeous, floating dropped ceiling detail of light-toned wood that gives an organic touch of natural substance within the contemporary design.
            High, beamed ceilings in the living area hover over a modern linear gas fireplace between cut stone walls. A line of collapsing sliding doors beneath tall transom windows creates a wall of glass between the inside luxury living and the dreamy expansive covered outdoor patio and kitchen beside the pool. Opening that wall combines both spaces on a beautiful Austin day. A built-in Lynx grill can service large gatherings of friends and family around sizeable tables and seating areas in front of the outdoor fireplace and TV.
            Built-in shelving lines the study that looks out through floor to ceiling windows to the beauty of a forever view into the hill country, lending a great environment for pensive writing or annoying payment of bills...it's a serene, inspiring retreat no matter the task.
            Every bedroom is lovely and every bath is distinctive, with designer finishes making each space special to inhabit. The master bedroom is a heavenly collection of pleasant, artful surfaces from the watery silver wallpaper to gently textured drapery that spared no expense and make this a tranquil escape. A freestanding tub under a barrel vault ceiling and an exquisite chandelier is at the heart of the master bath. A coffee bar and small refrigerator are just outside a workout room and the master closet is complete with full length mirrors, built-in ironing board and plenty of shelving and custom cabinetry.
            A game room, a media room with wet bar and icemaker, a large utility room, a three car garage...these are things to expect in a home of this quality, but all are rendered beautiful as well as functional in a home that delivers exceptional features with the highest taste level.",Single Family,30.28362656,-97.88433075,0,FALSE,2015,0,52272,5.666666667,16,7,4,650000+

An inviting stone pavilion/kitchen sits shaded by trees with a built-in barbecue pit, refrigerator and a rock fireplace that will transform a winter night into a mini holiday.

Open this beautiful haven to friends and family for the perfect entertaining sphere where guests can spill from the spacious interior to a backyard oasis with one of the most picturesque pools in Austin.  
            Built originally as a model home, it's hard to wish for a feature that isn't here. The dramatic centerpiece inside is the sweeping scrolled iron stairway rising between the entry and the two story living area.  Two tiers of windows curve as a wall of glass looking out onto the incredible back patio, pool and yard, facing east which brings morning light and protection from the sun in the evenings...a perfect Texas hill country setting. The covered patio is ready for year round use, with a mister system for warmer days and a fireplace and roll down clear awnings for our treasured, lovely winter nights.  The music system that runs throughout the house provides background melodies for al fresco dinners, swimming and relaxation.
            Indoors, the core for cooking and entertaining is a fully appointed kitchen with spreading granite-clad  work spaces and professional quality appliances including a stainless six-burner gas stove and suspended vent hood built into a stone alcove.  Double ovens and warming drawer are encased in rich stained cabinetry custom built to include pull-out shelving throughout, wine glass storage, a massive island with 12 drawers and a huge pantry...the perfect venue for culinary ventures.
            Also on the main floor, a guest room and bath, the study and a large laundry area accompany the lovely high-ceiling master with views to the perfectly manicured and private back yard.  Escape from frantic days with a long, luxurious soak in the deep corner tub or let stress wash away in the large mosaic tile and glass shower under a bronze rainwater showerhead.
             A second living area or game room upstairs is equipped with a wet bar and wine refrigerator and is flanked by three bedrooms with accompanying baths.  The magic happens a couple of steps down into a fantastic media room with a 1080P 3-D projector and a 7.1 surround sound system.

If you haven't already fallen in love with the house, you will fall in love with the location. 3 minutes to get on 183, 5 minutes to get on I-35 and Mopac, 5 minutes to the Domain or Anderson Alamo Drafthouse, 10 minutes to downtown, 3 minutes to more breweries than I can count, 3 minutes to the amazing Mexican food on Lamar/HEB, and ladies, you are .7 miles away from Target (my wife thought that was important to mention haha).

To make the deal even better, we are offering the home fully furnished! 

Due to COVID, we are not offering tours at this time. However, for the tenants that are selected to occupy the home, we will do a walkthrough and be happy to remove any pieces of furniture you do not want/need.

$350 Pet Deposit (would prefer no cats, as my wife is allergic, if want property furnished)

PLEASE EMAIL FOR ALL INQUIRIES
 In your email include your FULL NAME and EMAIL ADDRESS. I will send applications to those who request them. 

Looking for tenants with good credit/rental history and who will treat the home as their own. We use a rental property software called Avail, so applicants will apply via the Avail link. Only one person who will occupy the house needs to complete the application. This person should be the one who will pay the rent.

Tenants will be reviewed in the order in which they complete the application. Once I have an amazing tenant, I will inform all others who have been sent an application to not apply (the fee associated with applying does not go to me, and I don't want people to waste their money).

NO Smokers - We likely will move back into this house in the future and do not want the walls/furniture to smell like smoke.

3093,austin,"The complete remodel of this 1948 Brentwood split-bedroom home retains all the charm of the era with all the wow of now. Starting with the immaculate landscaping, new roof and driveway, this home has serious curb appeal! Visitors will be able to spot your home as the standout of the street with sparkling-white siding and five-panel mahogany door with modern glass accents, and they'll probably comment on the stylishly oversized, rustic planter boxes and all-new native Texas landscaping as well. 

The light and energy created by the 14ft vaulted ceiling in the living room is the result of a foundation-to-roof beam renovation that included stylish architectural upgrades. You wouldn't settle for anything less than the 6” White Oak plank flooring throughout this home which, together with stark-white walls, creates a clean look that's spacious and bright. Paired with dark accents like the modern ceiling fan in the living room and airy, black metal bannister that leads upstairs, and you have a clean, modern home that's ready for any style of decor, and the open floor plan downstairs will accommodate any size and configuration of living and dining decor. 

This brand-new kitchen design includes all-new stainless appliances, custom cabinets, white quartz countertops, and a clean, contemporary, textured white tile backsplash. The large window over the sink and glass globe light fixtures over the kitchen island create light and space in this area, and the island has additional bar seating. 

Floor-to-ceiling cabinets flank the refrigerator nook, giving additional storage. The highlight of this space is the oversized sliding-glass door that opens onto the patio, connecting living, dining and outdoor spaces seamlessly for entertaining. 

The large laundry room has the same beautiful sea blue custom cabinets and quartz countertops as the kitchen, giving you additional storage and workspace. Right off the laundry and kitchen is a lovely guest bedroom or office that opens up right into the backyard via a sliding glass door. 

The three-quarter bath has a spacious shower with clean, white subway tile and a built-in storage nook. The custom cabinets, black fixtures and the matte-black honeycomb tile perfectly reflect the clean color palette of the living area. Along with the other conveniences of this split-bedroom plan is a downstairs master. It's bright with windows and views of the surrounding trees, as well as a sleek black ceiling fan for year-round comfort. 

The master bath looks straight out of a boutique hotel, with glass globe light fixtures and black framed pivoting wall mirrors mounted on white shiplap. The quartz countertops and black honeycomb tile complete the space, but our favorite feature has to be this master shower! The square, tiled shower is tiled with matte white subway tile that gives it a subtle, sleek texture. Two storage nooks are accented with grey penny tile, but the absolute best feature is the high, rectangular window that gives you additional light and space while preserving privacy. And of course this renovation includes a must-have walk-in closet! The closet features the same 6” White Oak floors as the rest of the house with luxurious built-ins to maximize space and keep everything organized. 

Two more bedrooms and a full bath upstairs make this house private and accommodating. The third bathroom features a stark white vanity with quartz top, dark grey slate tile, and a bathtub/shower combo featuring vertical slate tile with a contemporary glass tile accent and stainless-steel fixtures. 

In addition to all the amazing upgrades, this home is also close to the booming North Burnet Corridor, as well as the nearby top-rated public schools, Brentwood Elementary and Lamar Middle School. You're also close to Paragon Prep for K-8th.

There is public transport at the end of the street and a park, pool, tennis courts, grocery store, restaurants and bars within walking distance. The home has a fully landscaped park-like front yard with tropical and carefully selected indigenous and drought-tolerant plants with big shade trees including a beautiful Magnolia tree. Private covered front porch with nice view over the front garden and neighborhood. Two front doors allow a home business to have separate entrance if desired. Home could be a 3/2 or two master suites with a 3rd bedroom or study. High end manicured grass in backyard with a new 12' x 10' attractive Tuff Shed (from Home Depot) for lawn, garden, sporting equipment and extra storage painted to match the house exterior. Lot backs onto a maintained city alley for vehicle access and potential for garage or apartment addition and is shaded and private with a leafy outlook. North side of property has an organic herb and vegetable raised garden bed and an attractive bamboo privacy border with neighbor. Fruit and nut trees scatter the lot with river rock and pavers for added landscaping. There are two long paved driveway strips for multiple tandem car parking at the front north side of the house for easy access to the front door. There is also plenty of street parking with a short walk to house entry. The front landscaping goes all the way to the street curb with no public sidewalk, eliminating foot traffic and adding to privacy factor. A recent addition and remodel has updated the entire interior, including brand new windows, new custom faux-wood blinds, a sliding interior barn door and five panel doors with glass knobs. The interior wall color palette of sage, chartreuse, green and grey tones and classic taupe are soothing and inspiring giving the home a wow factor when you walk in the front door.  There is wall to wall original and reclaimed vintage hardwood floors of 3 1/4 long leaf pine that have been recently refinished in a dark amber perfectly complimenting the paint colors. The wood floors are a major feature since you can no longer purchase that rare and sought-after species and size.

The master suite boasts his and hers separate closets and an en-suite master bathroom with two sinks, ample storage including over-sized drawers and a linen closet.The master shower is over-sized with a rock floor, a bench seat and a rain-head shower faucet.  The kitchen was designed with cooking in mind and is in the center of the home with a built-in desk and breakfast bar for modern needs.

The kitchen and dining areas will inspire you to throw a dinner party to remember! Worthy of an artist, the kitchen boasts black ceramic tile inset with exquisite teal art glass, recent stainless steel appliances and metal art accents.

It’s easy to envision one of these as a perfect pool room, since it offers a full bath, as well as plumbing connections for a wet bar. Enjoy the pool from this level: a full 9 ½ feet deep, it features a rare diving board and the shelter of a forest of trees.

5077,austin,"You'll feel the character and romance of this charming 1-story bungalow in desirable historic Clarksville as soon as you arrive at this property. Minutes from Downtown Austin, this 1925 craftsman-style home has 3 bedrooms and 2 baths. Unlike most historic homes, recent renovations have opened up the floor plan so that the living room with wood-burning fireplace, dining room, and kitchen flow together as one space. Upon entering, you'll fall in love with the antique pine floors that add warmth and character to the room. You will also appreciate the large windows that fill each area with light and highlight the magnificent original built-ins that line the fireplace wall. Regardless of the season, there is nothing like sitting beside a fire with softly flickering flames and the sound of crackling wood. What better place to end your day than in a cozy leather chair in this meticulously cared for home? This home feels larger than its footprint. Imagine entertaining in your gorgeous gourmet kitchen. As your guests sip wine, you can socialize as you wash veggies fresh from the market in your farmhouse sink. Then, serve your guests at the table as they are drawn into the dining area by the smell of a sumptuous meal and the clatter of dishes. After dinner, your guests will flow back into the living room for after dinner drinks and stimulating conversation. Then, when you retire for the night in your master bedroom, you can open the French doors to the back deck where you can relax and enjoy the privacy of your fenced yard. Grab a glass of wine and turn up the music as you enter your spa-like bath with marble tile floors, marble counters, and frameless glass shower. Or, a soak in your elegant claw-foot tub might be even more relaxing. If your guests stay over, there are two rooms that are suitable as bedrooms or a home office. In the morning, step off the raised rear deck onto beautiful, maintenance-free turf that is so much like grass you won't believe your eyes. It is perfect for lawn games or pets throughout the year. You'll love exploring this neighborhood. Walk down the street and find the trailhead to Lady Bird Lake or around the corner to Clarksville Park and Splash Pad. With Austin ISD's highly-rated Matthews Elementary less than a half mile away, this is a good choice for those with elementary-age students at home. You'll also love meeting neighbors at social activities at Clarkesville Park at events like Summer outdoor movies and ice cream socials at the community center. Your busy life will become easier now that you can bike to big events like SXSW at Zilker Metropolitan Park and pick up groceries at Fresh Plus, Whole Foods, or Trader Joes. Clarksville is part of Old West Austin and just minutes from the heart of Downtown Austin. One option is to leave your car parked and bike into the city. Clarksville is known for having an authentic Austin vibe. The city also protects and celebrates its earliest history. While new homes may go under construction, they must meet the guidelines of the Clarksville Historic District. This home brings with it the best of old and new.

7065,austin,"This five-bed, four-and-a-half bath, historic Austin home blends the elegance of yesterday with the style of tomorrow-- a unique meeting of enduring design and modern luxury. The original structure was built in the early 1900s, with recent additions being made by the world-renown Paul Streeter and his team at Camelot Custom Homes. 
The Mediterranean marvel sits on the corner lot of the city’s widest street, the sidewalks lined with a mix of oak and pecan trees. The wrap-around porch looks out over established landscaping and a lush green yard. The stucco exterior and custom carvings on the outside of the home are a masterful blend of Mediterranean flare and Texas taste. 
The entryway draws all eyes to the marble-tiled fireplace holding court at the front of the great room. Natural light pours through the oversized windows, flowing across the great room and into the formal dining area. Stucco arches lead into the gourmet kitchen, equipped with an immaculate island, breakfast bar, and ample counterspace alongside Bosch appliances and a Thermador gas range.
The well-appointed kitchen is flanked on one side by a second living area, and on the other by a casual dining space with vaulted ceilings and raised windows which garner even more natural light. The downstairs study impresses with floor-to-ceiling, built-in shelves and private French doors leading to the porch. 
Each of the three spacious downstairs bedrooms has its own en-suite bath, with the master suite offering both a shower and a Duravit soaking tub. A flex room near the back of the house provides the option for a second study or a fourth downstairs bedroom with private access, via French doors, to an additional yard space. A bathroom could easily be added to this room.
The hallway hosts a double set of French doors opening to a private courtyard area with rock and stone landscaping, outdoor plants, and another tract of green grass. 
An over-sized laundry room includes a sink station and cabinets galore, while the upstairs space opens into a multi-level game and entertainment room, two more bedrooms, and full bath.  If desired, the second floor is already perfectly designed to serve as an income producing rental property.  A three-car garage rounds out this remarkable home, which also includes a tax-saving designation as an Austin Historic Landmark.
Just beyond the low-set stone walls of the property, within easy walking distance, is first-class shopping and dining along the Guadalupe corridor, including Wheatsville Grocery Coop, Torchy’s Tacos and Amy’s Ice Cream.  Only two miles north of downtown, this prime location offers the easiest of access to all the best of Austin
